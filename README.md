Old Rite (Pre-Nikonian, Joseph-redaction) Texts in Unicode in Markdown

Дореформенные (дониконовские, иосифовской редакции) богослужебные тексты в Юникоде в формате MarkDown

## Sources

The Church Slavonic textual resources in this repository represent the pre-Nikonian Muscovite liturgical and textual tradition, now commonly known by the generic term "Old Rite". They contain the liturgical texts used in Russian Orthodox worship on the eve of the reforms of Patriarch Nikon (1656--1666), most notably, in the books printed during the tenure of Patriarch Joseph, 1642--1652. These texts continue to be used by the Russian Old Believers (Old Ritualists).

In collecting these texts, we used the following sources:

* [The Old Believer web site "Samarskoe staroverie"](https://samstar.ucoz.ru/) -- hosts a large number of digitized Old Rite texts, in both scanned and typeset formats, using a few variations of the *ad hoc* [UCS encoding](http://irmologion.ru/ucsenc.html#atop). These texts were converted to Unicode using macros. These texts were contributed by a number of individuals, including: Aleksandr Ivanovich Samsonov (of Baranchinsky, Sverdlovsk Oblast, probably a member of the Russian Orthodox Old-Ritualist Church [РПСЦ]); Sergei Petrovich Korablev of Cologne, Germany (a member of the Russian Old-Orthodox Church [РДЦ]); Aleksandr Yashin (РПСЦ); Iakov Zinovevich Tityun (of the village of Sarichioi in Tulcea County of Romania, РДЦ); Pavel Petrovich Kornishov (Lithuania); Ivan Kodochigov (РПСЦ); the priest Aleksandr Pankratov (РПСЦ); Roman Anoshkin; Aleksei Kirilin (РДЦ); and Aleksei Muravev of Moscow (РПСЦ). Some of the resources hosted on this site strive to meticulously reproduce authentic pre-Nikonian printed texts, while others follow the pre-Nikonian textual tradition, but were produced without strict regard for the typographical and textual complexities of the original sources.

* Ivan Spektorov in Russia typeset a few works in a variation of the [UCS encoding](http://irmologion.ru/ucsenc.html#atop), including the 1651  Moscow edition of the Augmented Psalter (Псалтырь с последованием, Pechatnyi dvor, 1651). He has attempted to reproduce original texts with meticulous detail.

* The [website Ustavshik](https://ustavshik.ru/), operated by a lay member of the РПСЦ, which offers an extensive collection of liturgical books and service texts according to the Old Rite, using a variation of the [UCS encoding](http://irmologion.ru/ucsenc.html#atop). With few exceptions, the vast majority of these texts have **not** followed the expected course of reproducing pre-Nikonian books with painstaking exactitude. Thus, we cannot find that any specific original editions were used as models. We can only draw the conclusion that the typesetters sought to produce a series of "idealized" (or amalgamated) texts that are practical for liturgical use. In these texts, we can see both a reduction of superfluous rubrics and the addition of some much-needed instructions, such as indications for when to make bows. The typesetter(s) also followed the methods of the Nikonian reformers by eliminating the majority of complicated word abbreviations, and confined the use of *titly* to well-known words, as well as avoiding final-abbreviations and other traditional space-saving devices.
